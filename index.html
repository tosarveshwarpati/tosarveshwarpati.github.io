                    Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

                During Feb2021-Oct2022; one and half year, I was engaged with optical laser induced breakdown spectroscopy spectroscopy and spectral data analysis as well as simulations of atomic spectral lines, electro-mechanical optical components and interfacing them with PC, electronics assignments from ongoing liquid spectroscopy laboratory establishments, writing computer programs etc. I have designed and prepared a spectroscopy chamber with variable axial electric field, to study effects of perturbative electric field on laser induced Plasma. I have also made a control unit, temperature and power monitoring system for Microwave LIBS setup. I have also written programs for iterative calculation of partition function, determination of Stark broadening in atomic spectral lines,calculation of other relevant parameters such as electron density and Temperature(using Boltzmann graph method) etc.

    <section class="about-text">
        <p>
            Apart from these research activities, I have also volunteered to popularize/teach some physics courses to the engineering (but also science) students who want to come to higher studies in physics. The courses I have taught during the last two years are Lagrangian Physics, Second Quantization, and Fourier Transforms. I am also a teaching assistant to a currently running online course on quantum field theory, organized by Infosys Science Foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
            My secondary interests also involve foundations and representations of QM, basis-dependent units of complex scalar fields elements, Hilbert spaces, Linear Algebra, old quantum theory, design/demonstration of home experiments, extraction of motivational/philosophical concepts from mathematics (Parseval-Plancherel identities, CSCO, Completeness, etc.), Linux bash, electronic circuits...
